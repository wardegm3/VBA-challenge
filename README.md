 Mod 2 Challenge - VBA: Emily Ward

# This project is to use VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data and draw conclusions. The conclusions we want to draw are:
    # Summarize the data by Ticker symbol
    # The stock price from quarter close to quarter open by ticker symbol
    # The percentage change of stock price from quarter close to quarter open by ticker symbol
    # The total volume of stock by ticker symbol

# Additionally, we want a quick analysis of the tickers that resulted in the greatest percent change increase, greatest percent change decrease, and the greatest overall total volume

# FYI, the output images are located under "issues" on the top ribbon
